# Huffman Encoder Project

This project tasked me with creating a file compression program in Java that will compress text files into .bin files. It uses the Huffman Encoder algorithm to compress the text file. This program also has the capability to count each word that appears in the file and store it into an ordered list. It also uses a binary tree search algorithm for accessing words with their respective count in the ordered list.
